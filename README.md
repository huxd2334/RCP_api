# Crop Yield Prediction API

This project provides a FastAPI-based backend for predicting crop yield using various geospatial and weather data. The API integrates satellite imagery, weather data, and machine learning models to deliver predictions.

## Features

- **Crop Yield Prediction**: Predicts crop yield based on geospatial indices, weather data, and user inputs.
- **Satellite Data Integration**: Processes Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat data for vegetation indices.
- **Weather Data Integration**: Fetches weather data for the specified location and time.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses pre-trained models for crop classification and yield prediction.
- **FastAPI Framework**: Provides a RESTful API for easy integration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
